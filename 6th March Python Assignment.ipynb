    "Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. It is used to understand and make sense of numerical information, such as numerical measurements, quantities, or values, and to draw conclusions or make predictions based on that data.<br>\n",
    "Statistics involves a wide range of techniques, including probability theory, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and data visualization, among others. It is widely used in various fields, including business, economics, social sciences, engineering, medicine, and many others, to make informed decisions based on data."

    "__Descriptive Statistics:__\n",
    "Descriptive statistics involves the methods used to summarize and describe the characteristics of a data set. These statistics are used to describe the basic features of the data in a study, such as the measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of variability (range, standard deviation). Descriptive statistics are used to provide insight into the data and help researchers summarize and understand the data. For example, if a researcher wants to describe the age distribution of a sample of participants, they might use descriptive statistics to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the ages in the sample.\n",

    "Inferential statistics involves the methods used to make inferences or predictions about a population based on a sample of data. These statistics are used to draw conclusions about the larger population based on the data collected from a smaller sample. Inferential statistics are used to determine whether the results observed in a study are due to chance or whether they represent a true difference or relationship in the population. For example, if a researcher wants to determine whether a new drug is effective in treating a particular condition, they might use inferential statistics to test whether the results observed in a sample of participants are likely to generalize to the larger population of people with the condition."
